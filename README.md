# PhotoRenderer
A tool used to render old Habbo photos. This supports the Habbo camera used from 2005-2009. How it works is that it essentially converts back the binary blob from the MUS data from BITD to a PNG file, and gives either the option of using greyscale or the traditional Sepia style.

## Output

Traditional Sepia theme:
